"""ReplayRolloutEngine: serve rollouts that were recorded earlier.

Developing an optimizer against live rollouts is slow and expensive, and it makes acceptance
tests non-deterministic. If a previous run's rollouts are on disk, the search loop can be driven
from them at no inference cost and with exact reproducibility — which is what makes a
zero-tolerance test of the loop's decisions possible at all.

The engine is indexed by whatever the caller puts in the data sample; the convention used here is
(candidate_id, role, item_id), which the controller populates. A missing key raises: a replay that
quietly substitutes a different rollout is worse than no replay.
