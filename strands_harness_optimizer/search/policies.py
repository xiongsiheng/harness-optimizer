"""Callable policies for the search loop.

Kept as plain functions and small closures rather than a class hierarchy: there are four
decision points, each is a few lines, and every one of them is something a caller may want to
replace. A factory returns a closure when a policy needs configuration.

The defaults reproduce the loop this design replaces, so that a replay of recorded runs can be
compared decision by decision. Alternatives (a gate with a margin, a per-item Pareto selector)
are variants of the same signatures.
