"""Candidate: an immutable snapshot of a Formula's tunable parameters, with lineage.

The upstream loop mutates one Formula in place, so a proposal cannot be declined and an
earlier version cannot be revisited. A Candidate is the smallest thing that fixes that: the
parameter dict, frozen, plus who it came from.

Immutability is enforced here (the params mapping is copied and exposed read-only), but the
Formula that executes a candidate is still a mutable object shared with the rollout engine.
The controller therefore materialises exactly one candidate at a time and asserts the
formula's params match before requesting any rollout; see SearchController._materialise.
